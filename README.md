  React - Redux-Rtk calculator mimicing the Windows calculators dynamic flow and more
</h3>

<br/>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<p>Building upon my knowledge of Redux and Redux Toolkit (RTK), I embarked on the creation of a feature-rich calculator application. This project leverages a combination of React's useState hook and Redux-RTK for robust state management.</p>
<p>To elevate the user experience, I meticulously replicated the logic of the Windows calculator, encompassing functionalities such as calculation history and dynamic ongoing calculations. Moreover, the application boasts a range of customization options, including theme and sound settings.</p>
<p>For a distinctive touch, I designed a unique theme and visual style for the calculator. Additionally, I incorporated sound effects to enhance user interaction and integrated an API to display motivating action hero images featuring the legendary Chuck Norris, adding a touch of humor to the experience.</p>
