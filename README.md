  Calculator that built with React with Redux-Rtk mimicking
  <br>
  the Windows calculators dynamic flow and other quirks.
</h3>

<br/>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

After some study in the realm of Redux I deicided to create my own project. Its
using a combination of React useStates and Redux-Rtk for statemanagment. To spice things 
up I tried to recreate the windows calculators logic including having access to  calculation history. 
I also added theme & sound settings and able to dispatch simple api calls to this projects hero, Chuck Norris.ðŸ¤
